Our MAIN priority should be finishing the code for the robot. If we do the extra points stuff, great, but we can't enter if our robot can't move.
We need to be working on that as soon as possible.
We are still waiting for the schematics to come off of the drawing board so we can program motors and servos accordingly.
ALSO: Make sure you remember to write your summary every day!

NOTE!: The robot code files will only work with a specific "version" of RobotC. You will know if the version is the correct if the "text functions" menu has the items "~Control Structures", "Natural Language", "Sensors", "Sound", and "Timing". If these items don't match up with the ones shown, then the code will pop up errors. Please make sure you are using the correct RobotC.

DONE!!! We have finished the mandatory code for the robot! The only thing left that we may do is program a bump switch. But that's not very likely. All of the code is finished. Claw, Arm, Drive, and Arm Rotate! HOORAYY!!!
