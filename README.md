Our MAIN priority should be finishing the code for the robot. If we do the extra points stuff, great, but we can't enter if our robot can't move.
We need to be working on that as soon as possible.
We are still waiting for the schematics to come off of the drawing board so we can program motors and servos accordingly.
ALSO: Make sure you remember to write your summary every day!}
